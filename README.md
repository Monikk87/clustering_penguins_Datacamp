# clustering_penguins_Datacamp
 
### Identify groups of penguins in the dataset

### Problem description:
The task is to identify groups of penguins based on the attached dataset.


### Data 
The data was provided in Datacamp and was added to this repository.


### Motivation
Via this project I wanted to practice my understanding of KMeans model and utilise the supportive visuals incl dendograms and tsne.
  

### Thought process
- I converted the object column to a binary integer one
- I examined what interia would suit best for the data
- I utilised interias visualisation, a dendogram and a tsne to understand the clustters
- I warpped the results in light of the project's questions
